= winget-metanorma

This repository is a downstream project that listens for `repository_dispatch` events triggered by the main Metanorma repository.
It automates the creation and release of Metanorma packages for Microsoft Winget, allowing users to install Metanorma via the Windows Package Manager.

== How It Works

1. The main Metanorma repositories triggers a `repository_dispatch` event when a new release is published.
2. This repository listens for those events and executes a workflow to:
   - Submit the PR to Microsoft Winget repository

== Repository Contents

- `/.github/workflows/`: Contains the GitHub Actions workflows responsible for automating the packaging and release process.
